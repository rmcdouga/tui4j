# Porting status

This page covers the current status of porting Bubble Tea to TUI4J.

## Examples

Table presents an overall status of porting code available under **examples** directory of Bubble Tea codebase. The idea
is to rewrite all the code samples and enhance TUI4J logic with missing parts found during implementation.

Each entry below represents a single example code fragment and the status of its migration into Java equivalent which is
represented by one of the labels:

`⚪ TODO` No effort have been put into this one yet

`🟡 In Progress` It's currently under development, and it might be some notable changes will be applied to TUI4J logic to
conform it

`🟢 Done` It's done like DONE, the example works 100% the same as original code does.

`🔴 Won't do` It won't be done because of some technical limitations or was done some other way with explanation in **Notes**.
